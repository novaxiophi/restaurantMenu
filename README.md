# A Restaurant Menu
====================================================================================

A web based menu for restaurants.  It should resolve some issues and help the business increase sales.

the menu should:

- have a easy and user friendly U/I
- be fluid and natural when used
- it should be responsive (Primarly use is for moblie devices that are connected to the internet and can read QR codes.)

<img src="_menus.html.png" alt="view of menu" title="phone view" height="600"/>  |  <img src="_desktop_menus.html.png" alt="view of menu 2" title="phone view" height="300"/>


====================================================================================
## Who will use the menu? I have a regular paper menu.

- the customers who naturally use their phones for most things.
- if you have a line of people waiting. They can view your products while they wait.
- people who search for your business online if you have it linked to your business

You have unlimited space to showcase the products 

You can add a section for advertising certain things at certain times like happy hour or valentines day specials like the one below

some requirements / specifications for the menu:
- statically created
- under 8MB in size
- fastload time
